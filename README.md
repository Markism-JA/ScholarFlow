# ScholarFlow

An app for my own use case. I'm not really sure how this would look like after I'm finished. The general idea is an app that centralizes a lot of the school and task things that I do. The app should be built on a framework that is cross platformed so that if I have time I can create a sync feature easily and doesn't have to worry about porting to different platforms. Aside from the usefulness part, the main goal of this project is to explore [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/).

I'll document the features here after I finished.
